# nmapfirewallevader
python

This script imports the nmap library and creates an instance of the nmap.PortScanner class. 
The scan() method is then used to perform the scan, with the target host specified by the hosts argument and the scan options specified by the arguments argument. 

The all_hosts() method is used to print the results of the scan.

You can also use the get_nmap_last_output() method to get the raw XML output of the scan, and then use the python xml.etree.ElementTree library to parse the output and extract the information you need.
